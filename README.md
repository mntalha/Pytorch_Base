# Pytorch_Base__
The purpose is to build base code for user using Pytorch library 

### How To
Since I am coming from C and C++ background , to see "main" files make me happy : +1

Therefore , I seperate the related class and files into folders such as 

[required_classes](https://github.com/mntalha/Pytorch_Base/blob/main/dataset) auxiliry classses 

[dataset](https://github.com/mntalha/Pytorch_Base/blob/main/main_function)  contains raw and processed images.

[main_function](https://github.com/mntalha/Pytorch_Base/blob/main/required_classes) main python file that will be runned.


# Requirements

- python3.x
- torch
- numpy
- time
- torch.utils.data
- torchvision.datasets
- shutil
